/*
Problem 2:
Write a function pingPongTracker that accepts no arguments and returns an object with the
following methods:
- timeSpentPlaying() should return the total amount of time you have played pingpong.
- playOneGame() should increase the total time you played pingpong by 15 minutes
  and return a string "Game played"
- myLevel() should return your experience level based on how much time you have spent playing
  pingpong. These are the levels:
  a) Less than 30 minutes - "I need to improve my game"
  b) 30â€“100 minutes       - "You need to improve your game"
  c) More than 100 minutes - "Wow, I have wasted a lot of time"
Example:
var myGame = pingPongTracker();
myGame.playOneGame();         // should return "Game played";
myGame.playOneGame();         // should return "Game played";
myGame.timeSpentPlaying();    // should return 30;
myGame.myLevel();             // should return "You need to improve your game"
*/
const pingPongTracker = () =>{
    let totalAmountOfTime = 0 ;
    return {
        timeSpentPlaying : function(){
           return totalAmountOfTime;
        },

        playOneGame : function(){
            totalAmountOfTime = totalAmountOfTime + 15;
            return 'Game played';
        },

        myLevel : function(){
            if(totalAmountOfTime < 30) return  "I need to improve my game";
            else if (totalAmountOfTime >= 30 && totalAmountOfTime <= 100) return "You need to improve your game";
            else return "Wow, I have wasted a lot of time";
        }
    }
}

const main = () => {
    const myFun = pingPongTracker();
    console.log(myFun.playOneGame());
    console.log(myFun.timeSpentPlaying());
    console.log(myFun.myLevel());

    console.log('----------------------');
    console.log(myFun.playOneGame());
    console.log(myFun.timeSpentPlaying());
    console.log(myFun.myLevel());
